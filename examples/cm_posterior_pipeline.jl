# CM Posterior from Real Data (SmoreFit)

This notebook is **Step 8** of the SmoreVerse pipeline. The earlier
`logistic_growth_pipeline.jl` covered:

- Steps 1–6 (`SmoreBase`): define an SM, fit it to CM data, profile likelihood UQ.
- Step 7 (`SmoreGSA`): global sensitivity of SM outputs to CM parameters.

The piece still missing is the *inverse* problem: given **real-world data** and
the SM you already fit per CM param_set, *which CM parameter sets are consistent with
that data?* That is what `SmoreFit` answers.

## The trick

You already have a profile likelihood per CM param_set — the SM-parameter
confidence region induced by the CM running at each one. SmoreFit
profiles the same SM against the **real** observations to get a *data-side*
SM-parameter confidence region in the same space. A CM param_set is in the
posterior iff its SM region overlaps the data's. Both sides live in
SM-parameter space, so we can compare them directly — no MCMC, no likelihood
evaluation of the CM, no expensive forward simulations.

This notebook walks through:

1. Build a set of CM param_sets + **real** profile-likelihood UQ at every one.
2. Generate synthetic observational data at an interior CM point.
3. `buildPosterior(...)` and inspect the result.
4. Visualize the posterior on the CM grid.
5. Compare the three bridge methods.
6. Switch to the graded posterior.
7. Query interior CM points off the CM param_set grid.

## 1  Surrogate Model

This notebook uses a simple exponential decay SM, chosen for its closed-form
CM → SM mapping:

$$y(t) = a \, e^{-b\,t}$$

with SM parameters $a$ (amplitude) and $b$ (decay rate). The CM has its own
parameter pair $(\text{cm\_a}, \text{cm\_b})$ that drives the CM's data
generation; in this toy setup the CM parameters map directly to the SM
parameters $(a, b)$, which keeps the ground truth recoverable and lets you
check the result against intuition.

## 2  CM param_set UQ — the upstream input

The CM param_sets form a 6 × 6 Cartesian grid over $(\text{cm\_a}, \text{cm\_b})$.
At each one we:

1. Run the CM (here: simulate by evaluating the SM at the CM-true parameters).
2. Fit the SM to the resulting CMData → `SMFitResult`.
3. Profile-likelihood UQ → `ProfileLikelihoodResult`.

Unlike the synthetic flat profiles used in Step 7 (which were appropriate for
demonstrating the GSA *machinery* without committing to CM execution),
SmoreFit's bridges need realistic profile shapes — the CI widths, not just the
midpoints, drive the answer. So this notebook does the full fit + UQ at every
CM param_set. With 25 points and a closed-form SM it still takes only a
moment.

The data-side noise level (`σ = 0.2`) is large enough that the resulting
SM-parameter CIs span the gaps between CM param_sets — without that, the
"CM param_set sampling density" caveat below would trigger and most CM param_sets
would score zero. In a real workflow, CM param_set density should be chosen against
the SM-parameter CI widths the CM noise produces.

### Build the CM param_sets

One `CMData` holds all 36 CM param_sets at once (its `cm_param_sets` axis), so
fitting them is a single `fitSurrogate` call — passing `P0` as a plain vector
broadcasts that one shared guess to every CM param_set's row internally —
followed by a single `quantifyUncertainty` call with no explicit index — the
resulting `Vector{ProfileLikelihoodResult}` is **row-aligned** with
`cm_sample.params` (`uq_results[i]` is the profile at `cm_sample.params[i, :]`)
with no per-point loop required. This is the same upstream convention
SmoreGSA uses.

## 6  Bridge-Method Comparison

The bridge picks how the two SM-parameter confidence regions are compared:

| `:symmetric_trace` | Max of the two-way trace-in-box fractions |

`:box_overlap` is symmetric and cheap; the trace methods give more nuanced
overlap on regions where the profile shape (not just its CI edges) carries
information. Below: all three bridges side by side on the same CM param_sets.

### Reading the comparison

All three bridges agree on the high-score region near the true CM point — that
robustness is the value-add of having three options agree. They disagree on
the *shape* of the falloff: `:box_overlap` penalizes mismatched CI widths
geometrically, while `:data_trace_in_box` is asymmetric (it asks only whether
the data sits inside the CM param_set's box, regardless of how big that box is). If
two bridges disagree about whether a CM param_set should be accepted, that
point is *boundary* in the SM-parameter space sense — worth flagging for
follow-up rather than trusting either answer.

the relative confidence information for downstream uses (importance-weighted
expectations, etc.).

## 8  Interior Queries

The CM param_sets are sparse. To evaluate the posterior at a CM point not among
them — for visualization, refinement, or downstream sampling —
`posteriorScore(post, θ_cm)` and `inPosterior(post, θ_cm)` interpolate the
per-CM-param_set SM-parameter CI bounds across the CM grid and re-run the bridge
against the data-side profile at the interpolated box. No new SM fits are
done.

Below: evaluate `posteriorScore` on a fine grid in CM space (40 × 40 ≈
1600 queries) and visualize.

> **Caveat.** Linear bound interpolation is only reliable when consecutive
> CM param_sets' CIs overlap each other in SM-parameter space. If the CIs are tight
> relative to how much the bound surface moves between CM param_sets, interior
> queries can drop to zero near boundaries even close to a CM param_set that
> *is* in the posterior. The fix is to add CM param_sets where the geometry
> changes fast — see the SmoreFit README "CM param_set sampling density" note.

## 9  Wrap-Up

The full Smore pipeline now reads:

| Step | Sub-package | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1–4  | SmoreBase | `SMFitProblem`, `fitSurrogate` |
| 5    | SmoreBase | `quantifyUncertainty` (profile likelihood) |
| 6    | SmoreBase | `sampleSMPredictions` |
| 7    | SmoreGSA  | `runSensitivity` |
| **8** | **SmoreFit** | **`buildPosterior`, `posteriorScore`, `inPosterior`** |

The shared backbone is the per-CM-param_set `ProfileLikelihoodResult`. Once that's
in hand:

- **SmoreGSA** treats those profiles as the *uncertainty envelope* and asks
  how SM output varies as CM parameters change.
- **SmoreFit** treats those profiles as one side of a comparison and asks
  which CM parameter values are consistent with real-world data.

Same upstream cost, two complementary downstream answers.

---

### Try it yourself

- Move `(cm_a_true, cm_b_true)` to a corner of CM space — how does the
  posterior shape change? What happens when the truth sits outside the CM param_set
  grid entirely?
- Reduce the CM param_set grid to 3 × 3 — does the interior-query interpolation
  still work? Where does it break?
- Change `noise_σ` on the data side only (leave the CM param_sets' noise alone) —
  what happens to the size of the posterior?
- Try `bridge = :data_trace_in_box` with `posterior = :graded` and compare
  the weight distribution to `:box_overlap`.
